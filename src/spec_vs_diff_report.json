  "summary": "Added a new WinLoveMessagePopup component with randomized love messages and 3-second auto-dismiss, plus new CSS animations. GameSection was updated to track love-message visibility and trigger it on win, but the diff is truncated so full wiring/reset behavior cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Clicking “Play Again” and “Back to Menu” clears/does not leave behind any visible love-message popup state.",
      "reason": "GameSection.startGame() clears showLoveMessage, but there is no visible evidence in the truncated diff that the handlers for the RewardsModal actions (“Play Again” / “Back to Menu”) explicitly clear or reset the love-message popup state (or that those actions route through startGame()).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "A dedicated component exists for the love-message popup (instead of inline one-off markup) and is rendered from the game win flow.",
      "reason": "A dedicated component file exists and GameSection imports it, but the provided GameSection diff is truncated before any JSX render usage is shown, so actual rendering from the win flow cannot be confirmed from the excerpt alone.",
