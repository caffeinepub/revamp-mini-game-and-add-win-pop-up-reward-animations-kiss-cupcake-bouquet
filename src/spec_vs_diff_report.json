  "summary": "The diff replaces the old color-sequence game with a match-pairs mini-game, adds celebratory win pop-up animations using the specified assets, and preserves session-based win state via useGameProgress. One requirement is partially/unclearly met around ensuring “Play Again” fully resets all game state in a single action, and there are some unrequested global styling/theme changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The game supports a “Play Again” flow that fully resets the game state (not just the win flag).",
      "reason": "GameSection’s “Play Again” sets UI state back to idle but does not explicitly reset the mini-game state at that moment (it relies on a later Start Game action incrementing resetTrigger). The diff does not show a direct game reset on Play Again (e.g., incrementing resetTrigger or calling resetGame) to guarantee a full state reset immediately upon Play Again.",
